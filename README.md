# Buckshot-Roulette-Probabilities
Buckshot Roulette, the indie game revolving around player choices within a  randomized game of "live" and "blank" chances, is a game really about probability. This repository models the simplest game form, akin to "level 1" within the game, although the application allows for customization not normally allowed in level 1.
